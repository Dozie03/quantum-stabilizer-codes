Error occurred: The circuit contains non-deterministic detectors.

To make an SVG picture of the problem, you can use the python API like this:
    your_circuit.diagram('detslice-with-ops-svg', tick=range(6, 16), filter_coords=['D37', ])
or the command line API like this:
    stim diagram --in your_circuit_file.stim --type detslice-with-ops-svg --tick 6:16 --filter_coords D37 > output_image.svg

This was discovered while analyzing a Z-basis reset (R) on:
    qubit 6

The collapse anti-commuted with these detectors/observables:
    D37

The backward-propagating error sensitivity for D37 was:
    Z0
    X2
    Y3
    Z4
    Y6

Circuit stack trace:
    during TICK layer #12 of 13
